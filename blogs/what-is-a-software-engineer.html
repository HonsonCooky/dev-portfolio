      <h1>&#9888; The Problem:</h1>
      <p>
        I've experienced a growing disconnect across programming communities; Every new idea or concept only works when
        you preface with <q>it depends</q>. While <q>software engineer</q> and <q>software developer</q> are often used
        synonymously, I argue that this conflation ignores a significant evolution in our industry. Modern programming
        tools and commercial expectations have reshaped the landscape, creating a clear distinction. We need to
        acknowledge the rise of a role that is focused on abstracted assembly, maintenance and integration, separate
        from the more theoretical or academic aspects of software creation. This differentiation is crucial for setting
        clearer expectations and fostering progress within the software field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we dive deeper, it's essential to establish two core concepts that will underpin our discussion, helping
        us avoid purely semantic disagreements. Understanding the following two foundational ideas (axioms) will allow
        us to move past terminology and focus on the substantive issues at hand. I also understand this can be a
        sensitive subject; My goal is never to belittle or undermine the brilliant minds thriving across the diverse
        landscape of programming, but rather to establish clearer domains where different experiences and expertise can
        truly reach their intended audiences and flourish.

    <section id="axioms">
      <h1>Axioms</h1>
      <h2>&#129504; &num;1 - Shared Qualia:</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Qualia</b> (singular: <b>quale</b>) refers to the individual, subjective, conscious experiences. It's often
        described as the <q>what it is like</q> aspect of mental states.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our brains form weighted neural pathways, shaping our perception through individual experiences. This inherent
        neuroplasticity allows constant learning but also strengthens established neural connections, making them
        resistant to change. While we each have a totally unique collection of qualia (perceptions), shared subsets
        enable phenomena like empathy and mutual understanding; Forming a fundamental basis where certain ideas
        <q>just make sense</q> without explicit logical description, and conversely, where others feel inherently alien.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, divergent experiences and reinforced pathways create challenges between people. When individuals
        operate within different conceptual frameworks, their subjective experiences of a shared activity become
        profoundly different. This divergence can make it difficult for professionals to find common ground, leading to
        misunderstandings and hindering progress.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h2>&#10853; &num;2 - The <q>Understanding</q> Continuum:</h2>
      <p>
        Many mature disciplines naturally evolve across a spectrum of knowledge that can be marked by three various
        specializations.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Theoretical:</h3>
      <p>
        First, we have the <b>Theoretical</b> knowledge base. This is the entirely academic realm, where the
        foundational principles and knowledge for some topic are established. This knowledge partition is about
        understanding the core "how" and "why" at the deepest level, often without immediate practical application in
        mind.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Practical:</h3>
      <p>
        Next comes the <b>Practical</b> knowledge base. Here, theory meets the real world, applying those foundational
        principles to solve concrete problems and create the foundation of realized components. This knowledge base
        relies on an understanding of existing components and their interplay with each other and the world.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Abstract:</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, we arrive at the <b>Abstract</b> thinking. This stage builds on the outcomes of applied theory to
        achieve large-scale results. It's about working with ready-made components, tools, and established patterns to
        build complex systems efficiently, often abstracted away from the raw theoretical underpinnings or even the deep
        practical constraints of individual components.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h2>&#128506; The World We Have Created:</h2>

      <p>
        By understanding Shared Qualia, our shared neural pathways, and The Understanding Continuum, which categorizes
        knowledge from theoretical foundations to abstract application, we gain a framework to describe the world around
        us. By recognizing how shared perceptions influence our experience of reality, and how different levels of
        expertise impact our approach to understanding and interacting with that world; This perspective is crucial for
        bridging gaps in communication and fostering more effective collaboration across any discipline, particularly as
        we navigate a world where diverse conceptual frameworks are common.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          It's crucial to acknowledge that different ways of thinking aren't measurable against one another. Like many
          interconnected roles in any complex industry, different functions serve vital and interdependent purposes. No
          single role can be superior; they simply fulfill distinct, essential functions.

      <h1>&#9883; Tying It All Together:</h1>
      <p>
        Herein lies the core concept that I'm trying to highlight. We find ourselves - like many before - on a knowledge
        spectrum, which has grown considerably large. Mastering the entire knowledge spectrum at a deep level is usually
        beyond human capability. That's why we divide and conquer, breaking it into disciplines so people can genuinely
        succeed within their area of focus. How I would outline the software knowledge spectrum is such (given with
        examples from other spectrums).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Theoretical: Computer Science, Electrical Physics, Chemistry, Material Science</li>
        <li>Practical: Software Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Chemical Engineer, Architect</li>
        <li>Abstract: Software Developer, Electrician, Chemist, Builder</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You may disagree semantically with my choice of titles here, but that's a matter to establish after we agree on
        the concept. The concept outlines that, for the Computer
