          The widespread, undifferentiated use of "Software Engineer" for all programmers is detrimental to the tech
          industry and beyond. Current labels, often based on specific technologies or user interaction, fail to
          acknowledge crucial cognitive differences among practitioners. This article argues against this broad
          generalization, proposing a solution that categorizes programmers based on their fundamental approach to
          problem-solving. By doing so, we aim to foster an environment where individuals can truly excel, expectations
          are clearly defined, and collective effort is precisely directed.

      <h1>&#9888; The Problem:</h1>
      <p>
        In today's tech landscape, it seems like anyone who writes a line of code, and mingles with cloud
        infrastructure, can be labeled a "software engineer." I feel like this broad brushstroke hides a serious
        problem: a vast, often unacknowledged gap exists between different types of programmers. On one side, you have
        individuals who see code primarily as a series of keywords to string together, focusing on syntax and immediate
        output. On the other, there are those who deeply understand that these tokens are merely abstractions built upon
        intricate underlying computer fundamentals. <em>This dichotomy creates significant friction.</em> While the
        former can often churn out a lot of code by diligently following established procedures, the latter, with their
        profound grasp of the machine, might find such rigid procedural work challenging or even counterproductive. Both
        write code, yes, but their approaches and the very nature of their understanding are miles apart.

        Often, discussions around "what defines a software engineer" mistakenly zero in on material details, like
        whether someone holds a university degree versus being self-taught. While these distinctions usually offer a
        rough approximation, they're pulled apart with exceptions and miss the crucial problem:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        There exists two underlying worldviews and cognitive tool-kits, which are essential for achieving specific
        desired outcomes, being labeled as the same thing.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Simply asserting that one <i>needs</i> a university degree to hold the title of "software engineer" without
        first outlining the outcomes that such a background typically enables, is fundamentally flawed.
        <b>So, that's precisely what I aim to do here</b>. We will dissect the distinct skill sets -&nbsp;the desired
        outcomes&nbsp;- and, more importantly, explore the necessary <i>qualia</i> (or fundamental understandings)
        required for each, moving beyond mere credentials to what truly enables effective work in different programming
        domains. Hopefully, to regain a common, semantic meaning by the end.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, I'll readily admit this perspective stems from a place of personal frustration - the constant
        miscommunications I encounter are incredibly taxing. Yet, broadening this beyond my own grievances, this
        ambiguity represents a significant financial drain for the industry at large. The process of finding and hiring
        the right person becomes unnecessarily convoluted, and you can bet that retention rates suffer dramatically as a
        result. I'm highlighting a widespread problem here, but I believe I've got a potential solution that, if
        embraced by the community, could significantly reduce these issues and
        <q>get the right bums in the right seats.</q>

        To begin our exploration, it's essential that we establish a shared understanding of certain theoretical
        constructs regarding the nature of reality. For our purposes, we don't need to delve into the underlying
        mechanisms or ultimate truths; rather, we only need to agree upon the existence and observable characteristics
        of emergent phenomena.
      </p>

        Our brains are remarkably adaptable organs, constantly forming and reforming connections based on new
        experiences and information. This inherent neuroplasticity means we are always capable of learning and evolving.
        However, the very mechanisms that allow for this change also lead to the reinforcement of established ideas; the
        more frequently a neural pathway is activated, the stronger and more resistant to alteration it becomes. While
        each of us possesses a unique set of experiences and perceptions, we can nonetheless share common subjective
        experiences, or qualia. This shared foundation of qualia allows for empathy and mutual understanding, and it is
        upon this common ground that we can explore the distinct, yet interconnected, modes of thinking that define the
        programming spectrum.
