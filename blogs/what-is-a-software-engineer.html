          The widespread, undifferentiated use of "Software Engineer" for all programmers is detrimental to the tech
          industry and beyond. Current labels, often based on specific technologies or user interaction, fail to
          acknowledge crucial cognitive differences among practitioners. This article argues against this broad
          generalization, proposing a solution that categorizes programmers based on their fundamental approach to
          problem-solving. By doing so, we aim to foster an environment where individuals can truly excel, expectations
          are clearly defined, and collective effort is precisely directed.

      <h1>&#9888; The Problem:</h1>
      <p>
        In today's tech landscape, it seems like anyone who writes a line of code, and mingles with cloud
        infrastructure, can be labeled a "software engineer." I feel like this broad brushstroke hides a serious
        problem: a vast, often unacknowledged gap exists between different types of programmers. On one side, you have
        individuals who see code primarily as a series of keywords to string together, focusing on syntax and immediate
        output. On the other, there are those who deeply understand that these tokens are merely abstractions built upon
        intricate underlying computer fundamentals. <em>This dichotomy creates significant friction.</em> While the
        former can often churn out a lot of code by diligently following established procedures, the latter, with their
        profound grasp of the machine, might find such rigid procedural work challenging or even counterproductive. Both
        write code, yes, but their approaches and the very nature of their understanding are miles apart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Often, discussions around "what defines a software engineer" mistakenly zero in on material details, like
        whether someone holds a university degree versus being self-taught. While these distinctions usually offer a
        rough approximation, they're pulled apart with exceptions and miss the crucial problem:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        There exists two underlying worldviews and cognitive tool-kits, which are essential for achieving specific
        desired outcomes, being labeled as the same thing.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Simply asserting that one <i>needs</i> a university degree to hold the title of "software engineer" without
        first outlining the outcomes that such a background typically enables, is fundamentally flawed.
        <b>So, that's precisely what I aim to do here</b>. We will dissect the distinct skill sets -&nbsp;the desired
        outcomes&nbsp;- and, more importantly, explore the necessary <i>qualia</i> (or fundamental understandings)
        required for each, moving beyond mere credentials to what truly enables effective work in different programming
        domains. Hopefully, to regain a common, semantic meaning by the end.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, I'll readily admit this perspective stems from a place of personal frustration - the constant
        miscommunications I encounter are incredibly taxing. Yet, broadening this beyond my own grievances, this
        ambiguity represents a significant financial drain for the industry at large. The process of finding and hiring
        the right person becomes unnecessarily convoluted, and you can bet that retention rates suffer dramatically as a
        result. I'm highlighting a widespread problem here, but I believe I've got a potential solution that, if
        embraced by the community, could significantly reduce these issues and
        <q>get the right bums in the right seats.</q>

      <h1>&#129504; Qualia Overview:</h1>
      <p>
        The concept of qualia is possibly not be widely known. Simply put, qualia is a word to describe
        <q>relative experiences</q>. For our purposes, we just need to establish a few key axioms about qualia to make
        sense of the distinctions we'll be discussing later. If you're keen to dive deeper, Simon Roper offers excellent
        insights in his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjZ3f-IXEXU">YouTube</a> videos. For the rest of this
        blog, assume <q>qualia</q> refers to the following list of "truths".
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Axiom One: Unique Interpretations.</b>
          <p>
            Every human brain highly likely to be unique. Thus, when two people receive the exact same information,
            their brains will process it differently, leading to potentially different interpretations or "outputs."
            Think of it like a "black box" - you put the same thing in, but you can't guarantee the exact same result
            because the internal wiring is different for everyone. We call this internal wiring <q>qualia</q>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Axiom Two: Shared Qualia Exists.</b>
          <p>
            While no two brains are 100% identical (Axiom One), portions of them, subnets, could be the same or resolve
            in similar ways. This explains the emergent phenomena of empathy. When you empathize with someone, you're
            not just understanding their feelings from your own viewpoint (sympathy); you're feeling <em>as if</em> you
            were them. This suggests we can have similar internal pathways; Allowing for a shared understanding of
            experiences, even if our overall brains are unique.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Axiom Three: Qualia is mutable.</b>
          <p>
            Our brains can change and adapt, forming new ways of thinking and understanding. However, how easily and
            extensively a brain can change varies greatly. This is because existing mental patterns can either help or
            hinder the development of new ones. Some concepts or worldviews are simply harder for certain individuals to
            adopt than for others, depending on their pre-existing neural pathways.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Basically:</b> Imagine everyone's brain is a shuffled deck of cards. It's incredibly unlikely two decks of
        cards are 100% identical in their pattern, so we can just assume all decks of cards are unique. Each deck of
        cards is unique as a whole, but it's important to remember that this rule only applies to the whole deck.
        Partitions of the deck could be the same across two decks. Finally, the deck can be reshuffled.
      </p>

      <p>
        This foundational understanding of qualia isn't just an academic detour; it's absolutely crucial for what
        follows. Disagreement on any of these three axioms will make it significantly harder to grasp the distinctions
        and solutions we're about to explore. If anything feels unclear, please take a moment to re-read and fully
        absorb these concepts before moving on.
