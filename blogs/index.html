    <p>
      As a software engineer, I frequently stumble into chaotic problems, and my process is to engineer understanding
      through iterative reflection &#128173;. This space serves as my sandbox to explore and refine the technical
      realities I encounter. I fully expect some of my ideas to conflict with established worldviews, so please bare in
      mind, this is by design. However, this only works with challenges to my perspectives. Diving into edge cases and
      understanding why I might be mistaken is how I truly deepen my understanding and build more robust systems. Please
      feel free to reach me through one of the listed contact mediums on my portfolio.
