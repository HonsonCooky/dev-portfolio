# Developer Portfolio - HonsonCooky

Welcome wandering developers!

This repo contains a `Vue.js` application for my portfolio/blog website. It is served as a static site via GitHub pages.
Mostly, this project allows me to explore frontend development technologies and provides a platform to store and develop
my ideas; However, if you're interested in figuring out a little more about me - head over to
